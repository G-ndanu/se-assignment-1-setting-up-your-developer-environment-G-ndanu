    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

Challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them
1. Visual Studio Code
During the installation of Visual Studio Code, I encountered the challenge of customizing the setup to include specific start menu folders and associate file types with the editor. Initially, these options weren't clearly presented in the installation wizard, requiring me to carefully navigate through the settings to ensure these customizations were applied correctly.

Strategies Employed
To overcome this challenge, I followed these strategies:
•	Thorough Exploration: I thoroughly explored each screen of the installation wizard to find options for customizing start menu folders and file associations.
•	Online Documentation: I referred to online documentation and user forums to clarify any ambiguities in the installation process.
•	Manual Configuration: When necessary, options weren't readily available in the wizard, I manually configured the settings post-installation by navigating through Visual Studio Code's preferences.

2. MySQL Installation
During MySQL installation, the primary challenge was understanding and adapting to the available installer options. Specifically, the installer only offered a "Server Only" option without additional tools like MySQL Workbench, which I initially anticipated having as part of the installation package.

Strategies Employed
To manage this challenge effectively, I utilized the following strategies:
•	Installation Adaptation: I adjusted my installation approach to focus on configuring MySQL Server without the additional tools included in the primary installer.
•	Supplementary Tool Installation: Recognizing the absence of MySQL Workbench, I separately downloaded and installed it from the MySQL website to complement MySQL Server's functionalities.
•	Verification of Functionality: Post-installation, I verified MySQL Server's functionality by creating databases, executing queries, and ensuring connectivity through MySQL Workbench.
